.Sh DESCRIPTION
puzzle\-diff compares two pictures and outputs the normalized distance.
.Pp

for more info.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Pp
Output distance between two images:
.Bd \-literal \-offset indent
$ puzzle\-diff pic\-a\-0.jpg pics\-a\-1.jpg
0.102286
.Ed
.Pp
Compare two images, exit with 10 if they look the same, exit with 20 if
they don't (may be useful for scripts):
.Bd \-literal \-offset indent
$ puzzle\-diff \-e pic\-a\-0.jpg pics\-a\-1.jpg
$ echo $?
10
.Ed
.Pp
Compute distance, without cropping and with computing the average intensity
of the whole blocks:
.Bd \-literal \-offset indent
$ puzzle\-diff \-p 1.0 \-c pic\-a\-0.jpg pic\-a\-1.jpg
